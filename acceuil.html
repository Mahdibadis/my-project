        <h2>GTA 5 - Introduction</h2>
        <p>Grand Theft Auto V, also known as GTA 5, is one of the 
            most iconic and successful video games ever made.
             Developed by Rockstar Games and released in 2013,
              it redefined what an open-world game could be. Set
               in the fictional state of San Andreas, the game 
               brings players into the sprawling, vibrant city 
               of Los Santos — a world inspired by Los Angeles,
                full of crime, chaos, and endless possibilities.
                 What makes GTA 5 truly unique is its three playable 
                  protagonists:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Michael De Santa – A retired bank robber
                 trying to live a quiet life with his 
                 dysfunctional family.
            </li>
            <li>
                Franklin Clinton – A street-smart hustler looking
                 to rise above the gang life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Trevor Philips – A wild and unpredictable
                 criminal who thrives in chaos and violence.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These three lives collide in a series of explosive
             missions, daring heists, betrayals, and intense 
             drama. The player can switch between characters
             anytime, exploring the story from multiple angles.
           Aside from the gripping story mode, GTA 5 also 
           features GTA Online, a massive multiplayer world
           where players can create their own character,
            build an empire, race cars, rob banks, and team 
            up with friends in epic missions.
         ith its breathtaking graphics, detailed world, 
         and freedom of choice, GTA 5 isn't just a game — it's an
          experience.
